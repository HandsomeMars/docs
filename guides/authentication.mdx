## Overview

JoggAI API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [JoggAI Dashboard](https://dashboard.jogg.ai).

<Warning>
  **Keep your API keys secure!** Do not share your API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, or any other public forums.
</Warning>

## Getting Your API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to Dashboard">
    Navigate to [JoggAI Dashboard](https://dashboard.jogg.ai) and sign in to your account.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access API Settings">
    Click on your avatar in the top right corner and select "API" from the dropdown menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Copy Your API Key">
    Your API key will be displayed. Click the copy button to copy it to your clipboard.
    
    <Info>
      If you don't have an API key yet, click "Generate API Key" to create one.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Store Securely">
    Store your API key in a secure location such as environment variables or a secrets manager.
    
    ```bash
    export JOGGAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `x-api-key` header of every API request:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.jogg.ai/open/v2/user/whoami' \
  -H 'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

### Verify Your API Key

Test your API key by calling the `whoami` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.jogg.ai/open/v2/user/whoami' \
  -H 'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

**Success Response:**

```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "msg": "Success",
  "data": {
    "userId": "user_123456",
    "email": "your@email.com",
    "credits": 100,
    "plan": "pro"
  }
}
```

## Authentication Errors

If your API key is invalid or missing, you'll receive an error response:

### Missing API Key

```json
{
  "code": 10104,
  "msg": "API key is required",
  "data": null
}
```

### Invalid API Key

```json
{
  "code": 10105,
  "msg": "Invalid API key",
  "data": null
}
```

### Expired API Key

```json
{
  "code": 10106,
  "msg": "API key has expired",
  "data": null
}
```

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Environment Variables">
    Store API keys in environment variables instead of hardcoding them:
    
    ```bash
    # .env file
    JOGGAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```
    
    Then load them in your application:
    
    ```bash
    API_KEY="${JOGGAI_API_KEY}"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="API Key Rotation">
    Regularly rotate your API keys:
    
    1. Generate a new API key in the dashboard
    2. Update your applications with the new key
    3. Delete the old API key once all applications are updated
    
    <Tip>
      Keep both keys active during the transition period to avoid downtime.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Access Control">
    - Never commit API keys to version control
    - Use different API keys for different environments (dev, staging, production)
    - Restrict API key access to only necessary team members
    - Monitor API key usage regularly
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="HTTPS Only">
    Always use HTTPS when making API requests to ensure your API key is encrypted in transit.
    
    ```bash
    # ✅ Good - Uses HTTPS
    curl -X GET 'https://api.jogg.ai/open/v2/user/whoami'
    
    # ❌ Bad - Uses HTTP (not supported)
    curl -X GET 'http://api.jogg.ai/open/v2/user/whoami'
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Handling Authentication Errors

Always check the response code before processing data:

```bash
response=$(curl -s -X GET 'https://api.jogg.ai/open/v2/user/whoami' \
  -H 'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY')

code=$(echo $response | grep -o '"code":[0-9]*' | cut -d':' -f2)

if [ "$code" -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Authentication successful"
else
  echo "Authentication failed with code: $code"
fi
```

## Common Authentication Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized">
    **Cause:** API key is invalid or missing
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Verify the API key is correctly copied
    2. Check that the header name is `x-api-key`
    3. Ensure no extra spaces or characters in the key
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="403 Forbidden">
    **Cause:** API key doesn't have permission for the requested resource
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Verify your account has the necessary permissions
    2. Check if your subscription plan supports the feature
    3. Contact support if you believe this is an error
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="429 Too Many Requests">
    **Cause:** Rate limit exceeded
    
    **Solution:**
    1. Implement exponential backoff
    2. Reduce request frequency
    3. Consider upgrading your plan for higher limits
  </Accordion>
